#### Brief Description of your Solution - 

The online Food distribution system was designed for the reduce of food wastage in Sri Lanka. Currently, a lot of foods get waisted because there in no intercommunication between Farmers and Customers. Customers do not get what they expected from farmers in exact period of time and farmers do not know what customers want in exact period of time. So this is a system that interconnect each other with their requirements. This system is used by three main parties. They are Farmers, Customers, Administratorâ€™s and Delivery agents. Customers can order from website Farmers can give their details for the system when they log as farmers. Then Administrator generate an order Id with by choosing requirement and farmer name . When generating this order id system generates an SMS and email and send it to customer and Farmer. When generating this order id system generates an SMS and email and send it to customer and Farmer.
Then the generated order Id will be assigned to a delivery agent and deliver it. This system helps to build good relationship between Customer and Farmers with out Intermediaries which provide good economic benefits for customers and farmers . Because In Sri Lanka a lot of Intermediaries gain economic benefits which should be gained by farmers and customers. in this system we took Intermediaries out of the economic equation and make other end points very strong.
